Hey Soma and Jessie,

I'm so sorry to do this again, but I just can't stay up all night to finish the read me, so I'll get it done tomorrow. This time, I promise I won't forget to circle back to it on time.

I'll write a proper reflection in the actual readme, but I really wanted this project to turn out great. Unfortunately, but then I ran into way too many problems along the way, and this is as far as I got before the deadline.

That said, I definitely want to keep working on this and turn it into a proper portfolio piece. Right now, even my ai2html isn't working properly, and there are just so many issues… but I did learn a lot!

So any and all ideas for improvement are more than welcome! I’ll upload a better version of this on Saturday, May 17. Ideally, I hope you never have to read this version. :DD
