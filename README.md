Hey Soma and Jessie!!

I'm so sorry I'm again doing this, but I just can't stay up all night just to write this read me, so I'll do it tomorrow. This time, I won't forget to get back on to this on time.

I'll do the better reflection to an actual read me, but I REALLY wanted this to be nice, but then I faced too many problems on the way, and this is where I got before deadline.

But with this one, I really want to keep fixing this more so it could be an actual portfolio piece. However, even my ai2htlm is still not worjing probably and there is such a many issues in so many things, I did learn a lot!!
So all the ideas how to improve this, are more than welcome! And on Saturday 17th of May, I'll do better version of this read me as well, actually I hope you'll nver end up reading this version.
