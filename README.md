**The Great American Ice Cream Love Story**

A Scrollytelling Exploration of Ice Cream Culture in the U.S.

**Goals**

This project was my first attempt at combining data visualizations, text, and video into a cohesive scrollytelling experience. My main goal was to experiment with:

Adobe Illustrator as a visualization tool
Getting AI2HTML to work for responsive chart integration
Learning how to incorporate video into web storytelling
Given the time constraints and the technical learning curve, I chose a fun and accessible topic with publicly available data: ice cream consumption in the United States.

**Tech Stack**

Data Collection & Cleaning: Python, Pandas, Numbers
Data Visualization: Datawrapper, Illustrator (+ AI tools), AI2HTML
Web Development: HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages
Video Editing: Final Cut Pro
Hosting: YouTube (for video integration)

**Process Summary**

***Data Sourcing***

I sourced data from the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and Statista. Though the data came as PDFs, I converted them into CSV format using ChatGPT and manually verified them for accuracy. (Surprisingly, the AI got everything right.)

***Data Cleaning***
Light cleaning and reorganization were done in Numbers for speed and ease of use.

***Visualization***
The flavor chart was made with Datawrapper.
The toppings visualization was created entirely in Illustrator, with AI-generated ice cream icons based on my own prompts.
The toppings chart was made responsive via AI2HTML.

***Video***
I filmed an interview in an ice cream shop using an iPhone and edited it with Final Cut Pro. The videos were hosted on YouTube and embedded into the webpage.
Narrative Construction
After the visual and video assets were ready, I wrote the accompanying text to unify the entire experience into one flowing story.

***Web Development***
I built the page using HTML/CSS, then published it via GitHub Pages.

**What I Learned**

I gained hands-on experience with Illustrator—especially how to create custom, stylized charts. It was time-consuming and full of trial-and-error, but rewarding.
I learned how to host and embed video properly, even though the visual styling still feels clunky.
I experimented with building a multi-format narrative—and now better understand what works and what doesn’t when combining text, charts, and video.

**Future Improvements**

This project is still a draft that shows where I’m heading with my storytelling. Here’s what I would improve in the next iteration:

Refine webpage styling: improve fonts, colors, image scaling, and overall layout polish.
Unify graphic style: recreate both charts in Illustrator for a consistent visual identity.
Improve video aesthetics: integrate them more naturally into the scroll experience, rather than as standalone YouTube embeds.
Enhance the narrative structure: better align visuals, video, and text to work in concert—deciding which medium is best for each piece of information.
Streamline workflow: plan the editorial process more intentionally from the beginning to avoid mismatches in tone or storytelling format.

**Final Thoughts**

This was a joyful way to test new tools, fail safely, and begin building the kind of visual, interactive stories I hope to tell in the future. Feedback, ideas, or ice cream flavor suggestions? More than welcome!!
